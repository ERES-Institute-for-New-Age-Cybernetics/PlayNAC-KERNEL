Overview
The ERES PlayNAC KERNEL is the simulation core of the ERES Institute’s New Age Cybernetic Game Theory framework. It enables real‐time, merit‐driven resource allocation, policy voting, and automated governance across multiple scales—from individual households to planetary and celestial initiatives. PlayNAC KERNEL interfaces seamlessly with:

EarnedPath (v2.3) – for lifelong learning, credentialing, and EP token management

BERC (Bio‑Ecologic Ratings Codex) – for environmental impact scoring

GERP (Global Earth Resource Planning) – for spatial resource forecasting

GAIA (Global Actuary Investor Authority) – for actuarial oversight of resource SLAs

By combining sociocratic decision workflows (SOMT) with automated smart‐contract triggers, PlayNAC KERNEL ensures that every action—whether a community “quest” or individual “credential issuance”—is recorded, scored, and tied to incentive mechanisms (EP tokens, Meritcoin, UBIMIA).

Core Concepts
PlayNAC KERNEL
A modular, event‐driven engine that seeds, assigns, and resolves community “quests” (tasks) aligned with ecological and social objectives. It measures participation via EP tokens and Meritcoin, adjusting resource flows and policy proposals in real time.

EarnedPath Integration
PlayNAC KERNEL incorporates the EarnedPath v2.3 API to synchronize token balances, issue credentials, and trigger quests based on skill certifications. The BulkTokenSync endpoint dramatically reduces network overhead for large‐scale EP updates.

Sociocratic Metadata (SOMT)
Decision‐making is conducted via SOMT’s consent‐by‐consent model. PlayNAC KERNEL provides interactive consoles for leaders to propose, discuss, and ratify SLAs, policies, and resource reallocation—automatically adjusting quorums (DQAM) in response to BERC fluctuations.

BERC & GERP Connectivity
BERC: Continuously updated environmental scores feed into quest prioritization and SLA adjustments. If BERC for a region drops below threshold, PlayNAC may auto‐spawn a “remediation” quest.

GERP: Live spatial forecasts (water, energy, migration) integrate into SLA simulations and quest impact projections. PlayNAC events update GERP’s global resource models to reflect real‐time actions.

Features
Dynamic Quorum Adjustment (DQAM)
– Predictive quorum recalibration based on real‐time vote history and BERC/EP metrics.

Merit‑Weighted Quest Seeder (MRQS)
– Probabilistic quest assignment balancing under‐served communities with historical EP contributions.

EarnedPath v2.3 Adapter
– BulkTokenSync for up to 1,000 User‑GROUPs per request; credential watcher triggers play events.

Asynchronous Event Bus (Akka Streams)
– Low‐latency intra‐node communication; average notification latency reduced to ~45 ms.

HUOS Identity & MFA
– TOTP + FAVORS biometric checks guard elevated operations (e.g., SLA approval).

Smart‑Contract Hook Validation
– Cryptographic signature checks for SLA updates; whitelist via GAIA before accepting new oracles.

CLI Tooling (pnctl)
– quest:preview and sla:simulate subcommands for pre‐deployment validation and dry‐run testing.

Built‐in Monitoring & Metrics
– Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for event latency, EP sync error rates, and quorum adjustment frequency.

Upgradeable Contract Proxy Pattern
– On‐chain logic can be upgraded (e.g., SLA_v1 → SLA_v2) without losing state, following SOMT‐approved proposals.

Architecture & Modules
Kernel Core
Event Bus (playnac-kernel/core/event)
– Actor‐based, asynchronous message routing.

Quest Engine V2 (playnac-kernel/core/quest)
– Handles quest definitions, assignment logic, completion workflows, and reward distribution.

SLA Engine (playnac-kernel/core/sla)
– Encodes user‐group SLA logic, oracle integrations, and automated enforcement.

Oracles (playnac-kernel/core/oracles)
– Interfaces for WaterSensor, BERC, GSSG, and custom smart‐contract event feeds.
