## 🌐 What is PlayNAC?

**PlayNAC** is the operational *Game Kernel* for the **New Age Cybernetic Economy**, integrating real-time metrics, cybernetic ethics, and bio-ecologic planning through voice-activated, simulation-rich environments. It is the orchestration layer that enables **EarnedPath (EP)**, **UBIMIA**, **BERC**, **PERC**, **JERC**, and **Vacationomics** within a unified governance and economic system.

> PlayNAC = (HUOS: Human-User Operating System) × (CyberRAVE: 72 Industry COIs) × (VERTECA: Vertical Trust Interfaces)  
> Powered by: EP Agency × GERP × NPSET × GraceChain × GAIA
