üìñ Overview

Purpose: Provide a modular, extensible kernel for PlayNAC that integrates:

EarnedPath (EP): Simulation-based merit progression.

GiantERP (GERP): Earth-scale resource planning engine.

Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex (BERC): Real‚Äëtime ecological scoring.

Goals:

Empower User-GROUPs with best/sound realtime media.

Enable seamless vertical integration via VERTECA interface.

Support pilot deployments (e.g., Bentonville, AR) with biometric signature standards.

üíæ Installation

Prerequisites:

Node.js >= 18.x & npm

Python 3.10+ (for EP simulation scripts)

Docker (optional, for containerized deployments)

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics/PlayNAC-KERNEL.git
cd PlayNAC-KERNEL

# Install dependencies
npm install         # JavaScript modules
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python packages

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Build & Run Kernel

npm run build       # Transpile TS modules
npm start           # Launch the PlayNAC-KERNEL service

2. Execute EarnedPath Simulation

python3 -m src.earnedpath.run --config examples/ep-config.yaml

3. Connect to GERP

Update src/gerp/config.json with your GERP endpoint, then:

npm run gerp:sync

üß† Core Concepts

PlayNAC: New Age Cybernetic Game Theory engine.

EarnedPath (EP): Nodes, merit, CPM/WBS/PERT workflows.

GiantERP (GERP): Global Earth Resource Planner API.

BERC: Bio‚ÄëEcologic Ratings Codex for real‚Äëtime environmental scoring.

VERTECA: Vertical integration layer combining CyberRAVE, GunnySack, and sale‚Äëbuilder interfaces.

Refer to docs/overview.md for detailed conceptual diagrams.

üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

Coding Standards:

Follow ESLint (JavaScript) and PEP8 (Python) rules.

Semantic versioning for all modules (Major.Minor.Patch).

Testing:

Write unit tests for every public function (Jest for JS, pytest for Python).

Aim for ‚â•90% coverage.

Documentation:

Update docs/ on interface or behavior changes.

Include design rationale in PR descriptions.

Continuous Integration:

GitHub Actions run lint, test, and build on every PR.

Merge only after passing status checks.

Security & Secrets:

Store secrets in GitHub Secrets; never commit plaintext credentials.
