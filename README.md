## Project Overview

The **ERES PlayNAC KERNEL** is the foundational codebase for the PlayNAC framework—an AI-driven, game-theoretic engine designed to **gamify civic engagement**, facilitate **real-time resource allocation**, and embed **bio-ecologic metrics** into decision-making loops. Its goal is to enable communities, municipalities, and institutions to negotiate complex policy decisions (energy, water, land use, emergency response) within a **Sociocratic Overlay Metadata Tapestry (SOMT)**, integrating classical and quantum optimization methods.

## Background & Motivation

Traditional AI platforms often operate in isolation, optimizing narrow objectives (e.g., cost minimization) without holistic consideration of ecological, societal, and long-term impacts. The **PlayNAC KERNEL** was conceived to address:

- **Multi-Stakeholder Complexity**: Cities and regions juggle energy, water, land-use planning, emergency response, and ecological preservation. Conventional rule-based or purely data-driven systems struggle to negotiate competing priorities.

- **Geospatial Dynamics & Earth Change**: Rapid environmental shifts (sea-level rise, extreme weather) create evolving risk zones. Decision engines must anchor conflict resolution in precise **longitude** and **latitude** to reallocate resources, adjust policies, and resolve property disputes as boundaries shift.

- **Sociocratic Governance & Transparency**: PlayNAC emphasizes participatory decision-making. By weaving every data input into a **live semantic tapestry (SOMT)**, communities co-author policy outcomes, build trust, and minimize litigation.

- **Quantum-Accelerated Optimization**: Combinatorial negotiations—e.g., relocating thousands of parcels in a floodplain—require exploring exponentially large solution spaces. Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms accelerate convergence on balanced, **BERC-informed** outcomes.

- **Resilience & Distributed Infrastructure**: Embedding **GSSG** panels as both energy generators and sensor nodes fosters a self-healing grid. If one node fails, others reroute power/data, ensuring continuity of essential services during crises.

By uniting these elements, PlayNAC KERNEL becomes more than software: it’s a living, adaptive platform for **Civilization II**—where technology, ecology, and human agency coalesce.

## Key Features

1. **Sociocratic Overlay Metadata Tapestry (SOMT)**  
   - Live, ontological knowledge graph indexing all nodes (property parcels, energy assets, hazard zones) by **latitude/longitude**.  
   - Dynamic versioning and provenance for auditability.  
   - Role-based views for each COI (e.g., LandManagement, EnergyResilience).

2. **PlayNAC Multi-Agent Game Engine**  
   - Agents representing COIs negotiate resource allocation, policy adjustments, and crisis responses.  
   - Classical simulation transitions to **quantum optimization** (QAOA, quantum annealing) as problem scale increases.  
   - Reward functions combine BERC scores, short-term service metrics, and long-term intergenerational equity (1000-Year Future Map).

3. **Geospatial Precision & Conflict Resolution**  
   - Cadastral records anchored with exact **longitude/latitude** polygons.  
   - Real-time hazard overlays (flood, seismic, wildfire) integrated via satellite and in-situ sensors.  
   - Automated ontological conflict detection triggers PlayNAC negotiations to resolve property, zoning, or resource disputes.

4. **GSSG (Green Solar-Sand Glass) Mesh Network**  
   - Bifacial, nanocoated perovskite panels achieve ≥25% efficiency under harsh conditions.  
   - Integrated MEMS sensors (temperature, irradiance, structural strain) feed environmental telemetry into SOMT.  
   - Modular shelters and rooftop installations deliver energy, communications (Li-Fi), and refuge during emergencies.

5. **Hands-Free Voice Navigation (HFVN)**  
   - Natural-language interface enabling situational queries, command execution, and audit reviews.  
   - Local edge-AI processing for wake-word detection; semantic payloads routed to core engine.  
   - Biometric authentication via BEST (Fingerprint, Aura, Voiceprint, Odor, Retina, Signature).

6. **Dynamic SLAs & Smart Contracts**  
   - Agreements codified on a post-quantum blockchain.  
   - Condition-triggered clauses (e.g., automatic relocation payment if hazard threshold at specified latitude/longitude is exceeded).  
   - Transparent compensation schedules (e.g., Merit Credit disbursement tied to milestones).

7. **Modular, Extensible Architecture**  
   - Clear separation of concerns across subdirectories (`src/core`, `src/semantic`, etc.).  
   - API hooks for new COIs, custom reward functions, and third-party connector modules (e.g., external GIS services).  
   - Comprehensive testing suite and configuration templates for rapid prototyping.

  user: playnac_user
  password: <YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
  name: playnac_somt

redis:
  host: localhost
  port: 6379

  tts_api_key: <TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY>
Environment Configuration
Local Development: Use config/local_config.yaml.

Production: Create config/production_config.yaml with secure credentials and scaled settings (e.g., Redis cluster, managed Postgres).

Feature Flags: Toggle quantum vs. classical PlayNAC via environment variable PLAYNAC_MODE (classical or quantum).

Running the Kernel
Start Backend Services

bash
Copy
Edit
# In one terminal:
source .venv/bin/activate
python src/core/server.py --config=config/local_config.yaml
This initializes:

SOMT graph database service

PlayNAC engine listening on port 8000 (default)

HFVN WebSocket interface (if enabled)

Launch HFVN Frontend (optional)

bash
Copy
Edit
cd src/huos/frontend
npm run start
Access at http://localhost:3000 for voice-activated interfaces.

Run Example Workflows

bash
Copy
Edit
python examples/run_playnac_demo.py --config=config/local_config.yaml
This script will:

Load sample parcels from data/sample_parcels/

Ingest hazard overlays from data/sample_hazard_overlays/

Trigger a PlayNAC negotiation for conflict resolution

Output dynamic SLA details to console

Usage & Workflow
The typical PlayNAC KERNEL workflow involves:

Data Ingestion

In Situ Sensor Streams: Push environmental telemetry (GSSG, HFVN, third-party IoT) to Redis channels.

Batch Upload: Ingest shapefiles, survey data, and cadastral records via load_sample_parcels.py.

SOMT Graph Construction

Nodes: PropertyParcel, HazardZone, GSSG_Node, COI_Agent, etc.

Edges: overlaps_with, monitored_by, depends_on, belongs_to_COI.

Persisted in PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geospatial indexing.

Conflict Detection & Alerting

SomtWatcher service continually checks for new spatial overlaps (e.g., flood zone encroachment).

HFVN sends notification: “Parcel #XYZ now overlaps with FloodHazardZone.”

PlayNAC Negotiation

COI agents register their preferences, constraints, and BERC weights.

Kernel schedules a negotiation round (classical simulation or quantum job).

Agents exchange simulated proposals; the solver identifies Pareto-optimal or BERC-balanced outcomes.

Ratification & SLA Generation

Approved solution is encoded as a smart contract (post-quantum blockchain).

Dynamic SLA stored as ontology edges in SOMT and mirrored on the chain.

HFVN notifies COI chairs and property owners of new SLA details.

Monitoring & Enforcement

Real-time sensor telemetry updates hazard indices; SLA triggers (e.g., relocation payments) are executed automatically.

Audit logs and provenance chains are maintained for after-action reviews.

Core Commands

Extending the Kernel
Adding a New COI Agent

Create a subclass of src/core/agent_base.py, implementing:

define_reward_function(self, somt_snapshot)

generate_proposals(self)

evaluate_proposal(self, other_proposal)

Register the new agent in src/core/agent_registry.yaml with a unique coi_name.

Custom Reward Function

Inside your agent subclass, incorporate new metrics (e.g., local air-quality index).

Extend the BERC scoring formulas found in src/berc/berc_calculator.py.

Integrating an External GIS Layer

Add a new ingestion script under src/semantic/ (e.g., ingest_custom_gis.py).

Update ontology_schema.json to define any new node types or spatial attributes.

Ensure geospatial coordinates (longitude, latitude) are included as node properties for OGC compliance.

Deploying a Quantum Solver

Configure credentials in config/local_config.yaml under the quantum section.

Implement a new optimizer class in src/core/quantum_optimizer.py that adheres to the interface defined in src/core/optimizer_base.py.

HFVN Language Model Tuning

Adjust speech-to-text and text-to-speech settings in config/local_config.yaml.
