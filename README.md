## 1. Purpose

PlayNAC-KERNEL is the **central simulation, scoring, and interaction engine** for **New Age Cybernetics (NAC)**.  
It merges **game theory**, **real-time data feedback**, and **bio-ecologic economics** to create a **living governance and education system**.

Where the **LOGOS framework** defines the **structure** of a smart community, **PlayNAC-KERNEL** defines the **dynamic behavior** of its citizens, systems, and resources.

## 2. Genesis Proof Alignment

This repository is **ethically anchored** in the **Generations to Come Declaration** (Aug 9, 2025), the ceremonial *Genesis Proof* of the 1000-Year Future Map.

Full text and permanence instructions are in the Proof-of-Work repository:  
[ERES Proof-of-Work_MD — Genesis Proof Section](https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics/Proof-of-Work_MD#whats-new-aug-9-2025--genesis-proof)

**Two Core NAC Rules:**
1. Don’t hurt yourself.  
2. Don’t hurt others.  

These ethics inform all scoring, remediation, and progression in PlayNAC.

## 4. PlayNAC Core Concept

PlayNAC transforms civic, economic, and ecological participation into **interactive pathways**—rewarding contributions, remediating harm, and building community resilience through transparent, voice-accessible engagement.

The “KERNEL” is:
- **Data-driven:** Pulls real-time inputs from sensors, user devices, and civic systems.
- **Voice-native:** Fully operable via **HFVN (Hands-Free Voice Navigation)** and **Talonics** symbolic input.
- **Interoperable:** Connects to NAC frameworks: PERC, BERC, JERC, UBIMIA, EarnedPath, REACI, and SROC.

---

## 5. Core Modules

### 5.1 EarnedPath Engine
Tracks **learning, skill acquisition, and civic participation** in real-time.  
- Assigns **Merit Credits** for positive actions (volunteering, mentoring, innovation).  
- Deductions for harm or waste, with **non-punitive remediation paths**.

### 5.2 UBIMIA Ledger
**Universal Basic Income + Merit x Investments ± Awards**  
- Baseline income for all participants.  
- Multiplier effects based on contribution quality and ecological benefit.  
- Reductions for ecological or ethical harm (with a path to restore standing).

### 5.3 PERC–BERC–JERC Scoring
- **PERC (Personal Energy Resonance Codex):** Measures individual well-being, energy balance, and learning resonance.  
- **BERC (Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex):** Rates ecological impact and bio-resource efficiency.  
- **JERC (Justice-Ethics Ratings Codex):** Assesses fairness, empathy, and alignment with community ethics.

### 5.4 SECUIR Stability Layer
**Silent Energy Circular Universe Infinite Rotation** — baseline physical and informational energy stability protocol for NAC systems.

### 5.5 VERTECA Interface
**Voice-Enabled, Real-Time, EarnedPath Civic Access**  
- Enables full civic engagement without screens.  
- Secure, multilingual, symbolic integration via **Talonics**.

## 6. Operational Layers

### 6.1 Civic Simulation Layer
Models community interactions, resource flows, and governance outcomes.

### 6.2 Economic Simulation Layer
Links Meritcoin economy to UBIMIA payouts, SROC trading, and REACI adjustments.

### 6.3 Ecological Feedback Layer
Ingests NBERS/BERC scores, adjusts city planning (via REACI), and alters merit payouts accordingly.

---

## 7. Deployment Pathways

### Phase 1 — Community Pilot (CIL Scope)
- Deploy in a district-level or intentional community.
- Integrate EarnedPath, PERC scoring, and Meritcoin economy.
- Begin SROC registration for renewable energy offsets.

### Phase 2 — Municipal Rollout (MGL Scope)
- Connect PlayNAC-KERNEL to LOGOS governance and operational systems.
- Add BERC and JERC scoring to complete the civic profile.
- Implement REACI protocols for adaptive zoning and migration.

### Phase 3 — Network Integration
- Connect to **GAIA** (Global Actuary Investor Authority) and **GERP** (Global Earth Resource Planner).
- Enable intercity Meritcoin exchange and distributed SROC markets.

## 8. PlayNAC in LOGOS Context

- **LOGOS Location:** PlayNAC drives NBERS scoring feedback loops.  
- **LOGOS Organization:** PlayNAC structures role-based contribution tracking.  
- **LOGOS Governance:** PlayNAC interfaces with SOMT for transparent decision-making.  
- **LOGOS Operations:** PlayNAC manages SROC market participation.  
- **LOGOS Societal:** PlayNAC gamifies civic engagement to keep participation high.
