ERES PlayNAC “KERNEL”

Empirical Realtime Education System × New Age Cybernetic Game Theory

PlayNAC is a human-centered cybernetic kernel that fuses EarnedPath (EP) learning graphs, GERP resource planning, BERC bio-ecologic scoring, and a hands-free VERTECA interface to help people and cities make better, kinder decisions in real time. The codebase has evolved through multiple versions (V4 → V7.x), steadily simplifying the stack while preserving rigor.

✨ Core Capabilities

EarnedPath (EP) engine — PERT/CPM/WBS-aware skill nodes, merit rules, and unlock/complete flows.

GERP integration — global/spatial resource planning hooks and simulation orchestration.

BERC — Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex for ecological footprint & remediation economics.

VERTECA (HFVN) — hands-free voice/gesture navigation for 4D environments.

BEST Biometric Checkout — humane, auditable “Bio-Electric-Signature-Time-Sound” flow for gated resource access.

GAIA/Keyword Matrix — 17×7 semantic matrix & domain weighting for intent routing and governance.

V7.x emphasizes proof-of-human auth, peer review, and expert advising while trimming complexity (token economics moved out of the kernel).

🧭 Architecture (High-Level)

Kernel services: EP graph, storage, media/task processing, consensus hooks.

Storage: SQLite persistence for blocks, EP nodes, and JAS links (thread-safe).

Semantic layer: 17×7 Keyword Matrix → domain weights → GAIA votes/consensus.

Interface: VERTECA voice/gesture → command routing → kernel execute.

A broader rationale and city-scale placement appear in Blueprint for Civilization II (SLA baselines, smart-city migration, governance overlays).

The Work Towards Core memo outlines hardening tasks (tests, CI, observability, device drivers, VR demo). Use it as your implementation checklist.

🚀 Quick Start

Install

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure

Create .env (or use defaults):

DATABASE_PATH=playnac.db
BIOMETRIC_THRESHOLD=0.70
PEER_REVIEW_THRESHOLD=0.60


V7.x ships a simple ConfigManager / StorageAdapter with sane defaults.

Run the demo

python examples/demo_kernel.py


Expected path: initialize kernel → create a few EP nodes → (optionally) verify proof-of-human → approve a project → mine a block → persist to SQLite.

🔐 Proof-of-Human & Checkout

BiometricAuth: heartbeat/voice “liveness” checks cached per session.

BEST Checkout Flow (Bio + Electric + Signature + Time + Sound): aligns kiosk scans, token debit, signed consent, synchronized timestamps, and a validated tone vector before resource release.

🧩 Modules (selected)

EarnedPathEngine — binary progression, prereq checks, credential issuance (hash-based proof).

Storage (SQLite) — projects, peer reviews, skills, advisors (thread-safe).

KeywordMatrix & GAIA — intent → matrix coordinates → domain weighting; consensus across 23 principal domains.

GERP Client — spatial dynamics & forecasting hooks for water/energy/food/shelter.

🗺️ Roadmap (from “Work Towards Core”)

Integrations: EEG (Muse/OpenBCI) via AuraScanner; VERTECA with Leap/Unity; multi-ASR backends.

Reliability: module-specific exceptions; structured logs; Prometheus/ELK exporters.

Testing/CI: ≥95% unit coverage, end-to-end smoke scenario, security scan, docs to Pages.

Packaging: Docker Compose (kernel + mock GERP + TF server), Helm for prod.

🔢 Version Lineage

V4.0 — Full system doc + math of PlayNAC/NAC, VERTECA overview, quantum & stability notes.

V7.0 — Expanded kernel with EP nodes, media tasks, JAS links, storage, GAIA domains.

V7.2 — Simplified: proof-of-human, 7 core development areas, ExpertAdvisor, PeerReviewEngine; removed token econ from kernel.
