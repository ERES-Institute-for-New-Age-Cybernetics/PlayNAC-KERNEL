Play Nac-kernel Readme (updated Sep 2025)
PlayNAC‑KERNEL

ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics · Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES) · EarnedPath (EP) · Global Earth Resource Planning (GERP)

A production‑ready kernel for PlayNAC — the game‑theory engine that drives New Age Cybernetics. PlayNAC‑KERNEL turns resonance into runtime: biometric/aura sensing → ethical evaluation → incentives → remediation → learning loops at city scale.

TL;DR

Purpose: Provide a minimal, composable core to run PlayNAC simulations, scores, and remediation flows across EP (EarnedPath) and GERP (Global Earth Resource Planning).

Signal In → Value Out:

ARI (Aura Resonance Index): ARI = K × F + M (Kirlian × Fourier + Munsell) → feeds EPIR‑Q (judge).

EPIR‑Q (Judge): normalizes/ethic‑checks signals: don’t hurt yourself; don’t hurt others.

UBIMIA (Disburse): UBI + Merit × Investments ± Awards → allocates value, time, and opportunities.

NPR (Non‑Punitive Remediation): targeted coaching, training, and repair instead of punishment.

Security: SECUIR isolation architecture; observable, auditable flows; privacy‑first by design.

Surface: VERTECA (voice/VR/AR), CyberRAVE (72 industry sims), Gunnysack (goods/services), Smart‑City (THOW, HFVN, FDRV, GSSG).

Concepts
ARI — Aura Resonance Index

Formula: ARI = K × F + M

K (Kirlian Effect / Engage): awareness, trust, bio‑electric signature acquisition.

F (Fourier Analysis / Relate): time‑frequency coherence; pattern/story alignment.

M (Munsell / Empower): colorimetric translation to intention/action. Output: Biometric Aura → EPIR‑Q.

EPIR‑Q — Ethical Judge & Normalizer

Translates ARI signatures via SPRT (Signal, Pattern, Resonance, Translation).

Enforces the two cybernetic rules: (1) Don’t hurt yourself. (2) Don’t hurt others.

Produces alignment scores, risk posture, and remediation recommendations.

UBIMIA — Allocation Engine

UBI + Merit × Investment ± Awards
Computes disbursements to individuals and groups; locks Centers of Excellence to Gravitational Relevancy across Smart‑City markets (PlayNAC).

SECUIR — Isolation & Assurance

Greenbox relay for Question↔Answer isolation, red/green zoning, tamper‑evident logs.

Role/space separation for CBGMODD: Citizen, Business, Government, Ombudsman, Military, Dignitary, Diplomat.

VERTECA, CyberRAVE, Gunnysack

VERTECA: Voice‑first & spatial UI (VR/AR), hands‑free HFVN.

CyberRAVE: 72 industry vertical simulations.

Gunnysack: 0‑waste circular goods/services marketplace.

Smart‑City Substrate

THOW: Tiny Homes on Wheels (scalable housing).

FDRV: Fly‑and‑Dive RV (mobility & resilience).

GSSG: Graphene‑infused Green Solar‑Sand Glass (energy + comms).

NBERS: National Bio‑Ecologic Resource Score (biosphere ↔ human harmony).

Key Properties

Deterministic cores with auditable randomness (for games/sims).

Event‑sourced state (append‑only, hash‑anchored: GraceChain).

Policy‑as‑Code for CARE/ethics gates and remediation templates.

Getting Started
Prereqs

Node.js 20+ and pnpm (or npm/yarn)

Python 3.10+ (optional, advanced signal adapters)

Docker (optional, for services)

Quickstart
# clone
git clone https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics/PlayNAC-KERNEL.git
cd PlayNAC-KERNEL


# install
pnpm install


# build and test
pnpm -r build && pnpm -r test


# run local services (event store, gateway)
docker compose up -d


# start the studio (dashboard)
pnpm --filter @playnac/apps-studio dev
First Run: Hello Resonance
# 1) synthesize an ARI signal
pnpm ari synth --profile demo


# 2) score it through EPIR‑Q
pnpm epirq score ./out/demo.ari.json


# 3) allocate via UBIMIA
pnpm ubimia disburse ./out/demo.score.json


# 4) emit NPR plan
pnpm npr plan ./out/demo.score.json

Outputs land in ./out/ and are also appended to the local GraceChain.

Typical Flows
A. Personal EarnedPath

Capture ARI → 2. Judge (EPIR‑Q) → 3. UBIMIA disburse → 4. NPR plan → 5. Re‑measure.

B. Smart‑City Allocation (THOW/HFVN/FDRV/GSSG)

Aggregate neighborhood ARI → budget under NBERS → allocate energy/shelter/mobility.

C. Governance (CBGMODD)

Ombudsman review of EPIR‑Q decisions; GraceChain audit; policy refinement via GAIA SOMT.

Data, Privacy & Security

Minimal capture, maximal utility: collect only what’s needed for remediation/learning.

Edge preprocessing: sensitive signals reduced to features at the edge.

Zero‑knowledge attestations: prove alignment without revealing raw biometrics.

Separation of duties: SECUIR zones by role and purpose; public vs custodial data.
