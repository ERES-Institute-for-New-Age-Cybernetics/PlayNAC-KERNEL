## Project Overview

The **ERES PlayNAC KERNEL** is the foundational codebase for the PlayNAC framework—an AI-driven, game-theoretic engine designed to gamify civic engagement, social justice, and bio-ecologic stewardship in real time. PlayNAC (New Age Cybernetic Game Theory) integrates an array of subsystems—semantic overlays, biometric scoring, blockchain connectors, and a virtual environment simulator—into one cohesive “kernel” that can be deployed within diverse contexts (e.g., smart cities, educational platforms, community governance bodies).

This repository encapsulates the core logic, data models, and interfaces needed to:
- Evaluate individual and group contributions via a Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex (BERC)
- Simulate real-time civic interactions in the VERTECA environment
- Map semantic intents to actionable governance strategies
- Integrate biometric authentication (HUOS) and game-theoretic feedback loops
- Connect to on-chain ledgers for transparent resource allocation

## Background & Motivation

Modern governance and community engagement face challenges in aligning individual incentives with collective well-being and ecological sustainability. Traditional civic-engagement models often rely on static hierarchies, punitive measures, and opaque resource allocation. PlayNAC is designed to overcome these limitations by:

1. **Dynamic Incentive Alignment:** Leveraging game-theoretic mechanics to reward positive civic contributions, encourage restorative practices, and foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders.  
2. **Bio-Ecologic Transparency:** Implementing the BERC scoring system to measure contributions in terms of ecological impact, social benefit, and personal development—highlighting real-time metrics that feed into EarnedPath and GERP subsystems.  
3. **Semantic & Biometric Integration:** Utilizing HUOS for secure identity verification and semantic overlays (SOMT) to interpret user intents, ensuring actions align with bio-ecologic principles and policy mandates.  
4. **Scalable Virtual Simulation:** Embedding PlayNAC within the VERTECA environment to model potential outcomes of policy decisions, simulate smart-city evolution, and test migratory planning scenarios before real-world deployment.  
5. **Open-Source Collaboration:** Maintaining transparency and extensibility by releasing core code, documentation, and interface specifications—enabling researchers, civic leaders, and technologists to build upon the framework.  

Through these elements, PlayNAC aims to catalyze a shift toward a more equitable, resilient, and adaptive societal fabric—one that can respond to global challenges like climate change, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Bio-Ecologic Scoring**  
  Implements BERC to evaluate user actions against ecological and social metrics, feeding into EarnedPath for restorative justice and GERP for resource distribution.  

- **Semantic Intent Mapping**  
  Parses unstructured user inputs with ontology-driven logic (HUOS) to inform policy decisions, conflict resolution, and adaptive rule enforcement.  

- **Virtual Environment Simulation (VERTECA)**  
  Enables administrators and researchers to create “what-if” scenarios—testing smart-city designs, migration flows, and emergency response protocols in a controlled, 4D environment.  

- **Biometric Authentication & Checkout**  
  Leverages HUOS for liveness checks, voice signatures, and multimodal biometric validation—ensuring secure identity in both public and private contexts.  

- **Blockchain Connectors**  
  Facilitates transparent, auditable transactions for merit coins, resource allocation tokens, and emergency relief funds via on-chain smart contracts.  

- **Predictive Seismic & Environmental Modules (FS-EP)**  
  Integrates Fourier-Schumann analytics for earthquake forecasting and environmental anomaly detection—feeding data to GERP for disaster preparedness.  

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Each subsystem (core engine, semantic, HUOS, VERTECA, BERC, blockchain, FS-EP, utils) is designed as a standalone module with well-defined interfaces—allowing independent development, testing, and deployment.  

- **Extensible CLI & API**  
  Provides core commands and RESTful endpoints for integration with third-party applications (educational platforms, mobile apps, IoT devices).

git clone https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics/PlayNAC-KERNEL.git
cd PlayNAC-KERNEL
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
or, if using Yarn:

bash
Copy
Edit
yarn install
Copy environment example and adjust values

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.example .env
Edit .env to reflect your local or production configuration.

Compile TypeScript sources

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
or, for continuous development:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Environment Configuration
Development: Use .env.development if needed, or override variables in .env.

Production: Provide a .env.production file (never commit sensitive credentials to version control).

Docker Compose: A docker-compose.yml is provided in the deploy/ directory for spinning up MongoDB and Redis containers alongside the application container. Adjust service names and ports as required.

Running the Kernel
Development Mode (with automatic reload):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start the server with ts-node and watch for file changes.

Production Mode (compiled):

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run start
Ensure that npm run build has been executed.

Dockerized:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
This will launch MongoDB, Redis, and the PlayNAC KERNEL containers.

After startup, the server listens on http://localhost:<PORT>/ (default port 4000). Check logs/ for runtime information or errors.

Usage & Workflow
The PlayNAC KERNEL exposes both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a RESTful API. The typical workflow involves:

Initialize the Database

Create required collections and indexes for BERC, semantic datasets, and user profiles.

Seed initial ontology definitions (found in src/semantic/seed/).

Register Smart Contract

Deploy the on-chain smart contract (ERC-20 or ERC-721) for Meritcoin or Resource Tokens.

Update SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS in the environment file.

Configure HUOS

Provision API keys and permissions for biometric authentication.

Define the biometric thresholds and liveness parameters in config/default.json.

Spawn VERTECA Instances

Use the CLI to create a new VERTECA simulation environment.

Load scenario definitions (geospatial maps, user avatars, resource nodes).

Initiate BERC Scoring

When a user action is received (e.g., submitting a task, attending a community event), invoke the BERC scoring engine.

The score triggers EarnedPath remedial actions or resource disbursements via GERP.

Monitor & Adjust

Use real-time dashboards (e.g., Grafana or custom UI) to visualize BERC distributions and resource flows.

Adjust semantic rules or policy directives through dynamic configuration (hot reloading is supported).

Extend & Integrate

Third-party applications can consume the REST API or integrate via webhooks for real-time event notifications.

New modules (e.g., climate risk analysis, water-security overlays) can be plugged into the src/ directory and referenced via index.ts.

Core Commands
Below are the primary CLI commands exposed by the playnac-cli:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Show available commands
npx playnac --help

# Initialize the database (creates collections, indexes, seed data)
npx playnac init-db

# Launch a VERTECA simulation instance
npx playnac verteca:start --scenario <scenarioName>

# Run BERC scoring for a given user action
npx playnac berc:score --userId <userId> --action <actionType> --payload <jsonPayload>

# Export BERC score distributions for analysis
npx playnac berc:export --format csv --output berc_distribution.csv

# Trigger FS-EP seismic analysis on sensor dataset
npx playnac fs-ep:analyze --input sensors/data.csv --output fs_results.json

# List currently active simulation instances
npx playnac verteca:list

# Shutdown a running VERTECA instance
npx playnac verteca:stop --instanceId <id>

# Connect to blockchain and deploy/update smart contract
npx playnac blockchain:deploy --network mainnet
npx playnac blockchain:update --contractAddress <address>

# Run all tests
npm test
For a full list of commands and options, refer to API_REFERENCE.md.

Extending the Kernel
To add a new module or extend existing functionality:

Create a new directory under src/, e.g., src/climate for climate-risk analysis.

Define interfaces in TypeScript and export them from index.ts. Ensure that any module exposing public methods is documented with JSDoc comments.

Update src/index.ts to import and register your module’s entry points (e.g., CLI commands, REST endpoints).

Write unit tests under tests/ following the naming convention <module>.test.ts.

Update configuration files if your module requires environment variables or custom JSON configs—add default values to config/default.json and document them in docs/USER_GUIDE.md.

Document usage in docs/USER_GUIDE.md and link to relevant API documentation in API_REFERENCE.md.

Increment the version in package.json following semantic versioning, e.g., from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0 for minor feature additions.
