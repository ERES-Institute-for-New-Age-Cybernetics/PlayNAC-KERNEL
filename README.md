# PlayNAC KERNEL

**New Age Cybernetic Game Theory Framework**

A reference implementation of the PlayNAC (New Age Cybernetic Game Theory) Kernel, underpinning adaptive governance and resource management for ERES Institute projects.

---

## Overview

The PlayNAC Kernel is designed to facilitate modular integration of socio‑cybernetic components into a unified environment. It provides core abstractions for:

- **Virtual Worlds** (VERTECA)
- **Game Mechanics** (PlayNAC)
- **Application Orchestration** (SECUIR)
- **Social Justice** (EarnedPath)
- **Resource Data Management** (BERC)
- **User‑Group Governance** (subject to GAIA)

Each layer exposes interfaces and data schemas to ensure seamless collaboration, real‑time monitoring, and closed‑loop feedback across vertical industries.

---

## Architecture

1. **VERTECA** – A 4D virtual environment providing spatial, temporal, and contextual dimensions for simulation and user interaction.
2. **PlayNAC** – Core game‑theoretic engine orchestrating events, scenarios, and reward structures based on predefined heuristics.
3. **SECUIR** – Application parent module that manages authentication, authorization, and secure data exchange between subsystems.
4. **EarnedPath** – A justice‑oriented subsystem enabling merit‑based progression, conflict resolution, and earned remediation.
5. **BERC** – Giant Earth Resource Data repository for analytics, planning, and reporting within the Global Earth Resource Planner (GERP).
6. **User‑GROUP** – Governance framework applying GAIA Smart‑City principles and Enneagram mappings to collective decision‑making.

## Features

- **Modularity**: Plug‑and‑play components for rapid extension and customization.
- **Real‑Time Feedback**: Bi‑directional data flows enabling immediate system adjustments.
- **Secure Interactions**: Built‑in cryptographic routines and blockchain hooks.
- **Sociocratic Governance**: Metadata overlays to support decentralized decision‑making.
- **Scalable Resource Management**: High‑throughput interfaces for global data ingestion and analytics.
