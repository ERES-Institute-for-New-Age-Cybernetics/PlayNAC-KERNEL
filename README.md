Overview

The ERES PlayNAC KERNEL is the modular foundation for the ERES Institute’s New Age Cybernetic ecosystem. It provides:

Data Ingestion pipelines for social media, email, and digital communications

Sociocratic Overlay Metadata Tapestry (SOMT) for domain and community classification

Empirical Realtime Education System (ERES) for adaptive learning modules and task orchestration

Global Actuary Investor Authority (GAIA) for policy voting and domain intelligence

Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex (BERC) & Graceful Contribution Formula (GCF) for ecological and merit scoring

National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (NBERS) for country-level aggregation

Meritcoin & Gracechain tokenization on blockchain

Developers can extend and integrate each core module to customize PlayNAC deployments.

Installation

Prerequisites:

Node.js ≥ 18.x & npm

Python ≥ 3.10 (for EarnedPath simulations)

Docker & Docker Compose (optional)

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ERES-Institute-for-New-Age-Cybernetics/PlayNAC-KERNEL.git
cd PlayNAC-KERNEL

Install dependencies

npm install      # JavaScript modules
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python packages

Configure environment

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with database URLs, API keys, and secrets

Usage

Build & Run the Kernel

npm run build    # Transpile TypeScript modules
npm start        # Launch the PlayNAC-KERNEL service

Execute EarnedPath Simulation

python3 -m src.earnedpath.run \
  --config examples/ep-config.yaml

Synchronize with GiantERP (GERP)

npm run gerp:sync

Run Tests

npm test            # JavaScript tests (Jest)
pytest tests/       # Python tests

Core Concepts

PlayNAC: New Age Cybernetic Game Theory engine for real-time merit and reward

EarnedPath (EP): Simulation-based progression using nodes, CPM/WBS/PERT workflows

GiantERP (GERP): Global Earth Resource Planning API integration

BERC: Bio-Ecologic Ratings Codex for ecological and social impact scoring

GCF: Graceful Contribution Formula combining ecological and merit credits

VERTECA: Vertical interface layer (CyberRAVE, GunnySack, Sale-builder)

SOMT: Sociocratic Overlay Metadata Tapestry for domain-driven classification

NBERS: National Bio-Ecologic Resource Score (country-level index)

Tokens: Meritcoin for knowledge contributions; Gracechain for ecological/ethical actions

Refer to docs/overview.md and docs/semantic-fields.md for detailed diagrams and full keyword definitions.

Development Guidelines

Coding Standards: ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript; PEP8 for Python

Versioning: Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

Testing: Aim for ≥90% coverage; write unit tests for all public functions

Documentation: Update docs/ on any interface or behavior change; include design rationale in PRs

CI/CD: GitHub Actions run lint, test, and build on every pull request

Security: Store secrets in GitHub Secrets; never commit credentials in plaintext
